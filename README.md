# Zen - A Mental Health Companion

Zen is a mental health tracker website that serves as your personal companion to monitor and improve your mental well-being. With its aesthetically pleasing design and user-friendly interface, Zen offers a less intrusive and enjoyable way to focus on your mental fitness. This project was developed as part of my sixth-semester Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).

## Features

- **Mental Health Tracking:** Users can input their mental health data through a series of questions and visualize their progress throughout the week.
- **Notes and To-Do Lists:** Users can keep track of their thoughts and tasks conveniently within the website.
- **Motivational Quotes:** A carousel of motivational quotes inspires users and uplifts their spirits.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication using Flask-Security for personalized experiences.
- **Charts:** Visualize your mental health data with interactive charts created using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).
- **Music Player:** Listen to chill and relaxing music (contributed by [kkelizz](https://github.com/kkelizzz) - [reference](https://www.codewithrandom.com/2023/02/12/simple-html-music-player-music-player-project-in-html-and-css-codewithrandom/))
